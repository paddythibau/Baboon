//! What the Campaign Evolved import gate does with a tag from another game.
//!
//! The gate compared an imported tag against one profile with
//! `compare_root_layout`, which by construction looks at the *root* struct only:
//! group, version, root size, root field list. Anything short of a clean match
//! was treated as one kind of problem -- benign drift the user could wave
//! through with "Import anyway".
//!
//! That conflates two situations which need opposite answers. A tag saved by an
//! older toolset against a drifted Campaign Evolved layout really is safe to
//! wave through, and the override exists for it. A tag authored for *another
//! game* is not, and `model_animation_graph` is the case that proves it.
//!
//! It proves it harder than expected. The Reach and Campaign Evolved jmad root
//! structs are not merely the same size -- they are field-for-field identical
//! once `collect_fields` drops the zero-byte `explanation` and `terminator`
//! sentinels, their only textual difference. So `compare_root_layout` returns
//! `Match`: a Halo Reach animation graph imports into Campaign Evolved under a
//! green "Schema matches" tick, with no warning to wave through and no override
//! to tick. Meanwhile four nested structs are the wrong size --
//! `shared_model_animation_block` 212 vs 200, `animation_graph_node_block` 44 vs
//! 40, `animation_ik_set_item` 4 vs 8, `new_animation_blend_screen_block_struct`
//! 44 vs 48.
//!
//! The consequence for the fix: no amount of root-level comparison can tell the
//! two situations apart, so the classifier asks
//! `blam_tags::struct_trees_are_wire_identical` instead, which walks the whole
//! struct graph. These tests pin the hole and that it is now closed.
