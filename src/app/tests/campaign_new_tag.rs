//! Creating a Campaign Evolved tag in a group the game ships no instance of.
//!
//! The dialog offers all 141 groups the definitions define, but the game ships a
//! tag for only 101 of them. Creation used to require an existing same-group
//! `.uasset` to donate the UE5 package structure, so the other 40 -- among them
//! `cinematic_scene`, the reported case -- could not be created at all. The
//! wrapper is now *derived* from the group's own rules when no same-group tag
//! ships, which covers 36 of those 40. The last four are `object`, `unit`,
//! `item` and `device`: Halo's abstract base groups, which have no standalone
//! instances by design and stay refused.
