//! Turning a [`LevelScene`] into a USD scene.
//! It owns the scene-to-USD conversion; reading cells belongs to
//! [`super::level`], and mesh decoding belongs to `blam-tags`.
//!
//! USD describes a scene, not a mesh, and its instancing is exactly what a
//! level needs: each mesh is written once as a prototype, and every placement is
//! an `instanceable` prim that references it. Counted over all 2,334 of its
//! cells, C10 places 296,399 copies of 745 meshes, so storing geometry per
//! placement is the difference between a file that opens and one that does not.
//!
//! A placement is a `matrix4d`, which matters more than it sounds. Roughly a
//! fifth of Campaign Evolved's placements are non-uniformly scaled or mirrored,
//! and a format carrying only a quaternion and a single scale can say neither —
//! it has to bake per-placement geometry, losing exactly the sharing that made
//! the export affordable. A matrix says all of it exactly, and USD's is
//! row-major with the translation in the last row, which is Unreal's own
//! `FMatrix` layout, so a placement is written through unchanged.
//!
//! Units stay Unreal's centimetres, declared as `metersPerUnit`, and the scene
//! is Z-up as both Unreal and Blender are.
