//! Splitting a level's placements into segments an importer can actually open.
//! It owns the spatial division and its budgets; reading cells belongs to
//! [`super::level`], and writing files belongs to [`super::level_export`].
//!
//! A whole level does not import. Measured against Blender: 56 million
//! triangles across 14,049 placements opens, and 109.7 million across 296,399
//! does not. Two different things run out, so a segment is bounded by both — a
//! dense stand of foliage can hold a placement for every leaf while reusing a
//! handful of meshes, and a segment budgeted only on geometry would sail past
//! the object count that is the actual ceiling there.
//!
//! The division is spatial, and has to be. Cells arrive in the order the pak
//! lists them, which carries no geometric meaning at all: 27 cells read that way
//! spanned 404 x 421 x 279 m of a level that is 797 x 1137 x 448 m in total.
//! Segments are therefore cut from placement positions, by repeatedly halving
//! the widest axis at the median until both budgets are met, which follows the
//! level's own density rather than imposing a grid on it — a grid would put
//! thousands of segments across empty terrain and still overflow inside a
//! building.
//!
//! Geometry is counted per *distinct mesh*, not per placement. Every segment
//! references one shared prototype library, so what a segment costs to open is
//! the meshes it names once each, however many times it places them.
