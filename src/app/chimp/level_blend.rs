//! Writing a level as raw geometry for Blender to assemble into `.blend` files.
//! It owns the sidecar format and the script emitted beside it; segmentation
//! belongs to [`super::level_segment`], and USD to [`super::level_export`].
//!
//! Baboon cannot write a `.blend`. The format is a dump of Blender's internal
//! structs — pointer-based, described by its own embedded SDNA, and re-laid-out
//! between releases. Reading one is possible; writing one that a given Blender
//! will open is a version-locked commitment no exporter should make. So the
//! `.blend` files are built *by Blender*, from a sidecar this module writes and
//! a script it emits alongside.
//!
//! The sidecar is raw little-endian arrays because that is the entire point: a
//! position costs 12 bytes here against roughly 24 characters as USD text, which
//! is the difference between 3.8 GB and 8.6 GB for C10. Blender's `foreach_set`
//! consumes flat buffers directly, so the script does no per-vertex work in
//! Python.
//!
//! Geometry is stored in the convention the destination wants rather than the
//! one Unreal uses — triangles wound counter-clockwise and V running up the
//! image — so the script stays a reader rather than a converter.
