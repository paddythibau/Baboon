//! Ledger of Campaign Evolved tags this installation created by duplication.
//! It owns the record of what Baboon authored inside a container; container
//! mutation, eligibility presentation, and workflow coordination belong elsewhere.
//!
//! A duplicated container tag is indistinguishable from a shipped one once it is
//! in the pak: it mounts as an ordinary `TagEntryLocation::Container`, the
//! project database files it as `CampaignProjectTagKind::Existing`, and nothing
//! in the container itself records who put it there. Deleting only what Baboon
//! authored therefore needs an explicit, persistent record — this one — kept
//! beside the rest of the installation's state rather than inside the game's
//! files, so a game update or a reinstall never launders a shipped tag into a
//! deletable one.
