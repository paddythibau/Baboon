//! The write lifecycle for Campaign Evolved IoStore containers: taking a
//! container out of service, unmapping it, swapping its files, and putting it
//! back. Reading and mounting containers belongs to `src/source/`; drawing the
//! outcome belongs to `src/app/ui/`.
//!
//! Windows is the reason this exists. A mounted container's `.ucas` is
//! memory-mapped and the Chimp workspace keeps a live handle on every `.pak`,
//! so a write that *truncates* those files fails at the OS with
//! `ERROR_USER_MAPPED_FILE` (1224) or `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` (32) and
//! nothing connects the error to the mod being installed. Not every write
//! truncates, though: the in-place duplicate/delete writer only appends to the
//! `.ucas` and swaps the `.utoc` by rename, and it *reads through the very
//! mapping* an unmap would take away. So a lease says which kind of write it
//! is, and only the truncating kind unmaps.
