# Baboon

**Baboon** is a native desktop viewer and editor for Halo tag files, built in
Rust with [`eframe`/`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui). It links the [`blam-tags`](https://github.com/camden-smallwood/blam-tags) engine directly for
byte-exact tag reading, editing, and asset extraction, and presents a
Guerilla-style editing surface for working with the loose tag files shipped in
the **Halo: The Master Chief Collection** editing kits — no round-trip through
the official tools required.

Open a single tag, an entire editing-kit `tags/` folder, a monolithic tag cache,
or a Halo: Campaign Evolved install — **several at once**, each in its own
workspace, side by side. Browse and search the tag tree (by name *or* field
value); edit fields, blocks, shaders, and functions inline with full undo/redo;
preview bitmaps and 3D models; trace references and diff tags; duplicate and
delete tags; and extract geometry, textures, and animations — all from one
application. For Halo: Campaign Evolved there is a second workspace, **Chimp**,
for editing the game's Unreal packages directly.

> Baboon is the GUI front end for the `blam-tags` project. The library does the
> binary tag parsing; Baboon is the interactive editor built on top of it.

## Supported games

Baboon recognises and auto-configures itself for the following games. The MCC
editing kits are detected from the kit's root folder name; Halo: Campaign
Evolved is mounted from its game install (see the footnote and *Campaign Evolved
mods* below):

| Game                     | Folder                        | Game identifier  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Halo CE                  | `HCEEK` / `H1EK`              | `haloce_mcc`     |
| Halo 2                   | `H2EK`                        | `halo2_mcc`      |
| Halo 3                   | `H3EK`                        | `halo3_mcc`      |
| Halo 3: ODST             | `H3ODSTEK`                    | `halo3odst_mcc`  |
| Halo: Reach              | `HREK`                        | `haloreach_mcc`  |
| Halo 4                   | `H4EK`                        | `halo4_mcc`      |
| Halo 2: Anniversary (MP) | `H2AMPEK` / `H2AEK`          | `halo2amp_mcc`   |
| Halo: Campaign Evolved † | game install (IoStore paks)   | `haloce_evolved` |

The MCC game is also detected from a folder literally named after the game id
(e.g. `halo3_mcc`), and **custom editing-kit folder names** can be mapped to a
game in *File → Settings* for non-standard layouts.

† **Halo: Campaign Evolved** is not an MCC editing kit — it's the UE5 remake of
Halo 1 on a modified Reach engine, whose Reach-format tags are cooked into UE5
IoStore paks. It's mounted from its game folder via **Load Folder** rather than a
`tags/` directory; see *Campaign Evolved mods* below.

Per-game group-name tables and schemas are loaded from
`definitions/<game>/*.json`. Release builds place the `definitions/` folder next
to `Baboon.exe`, which keeps the schemas inspectable and editable without
rebuilding the app.

## Features

### Loading tag sources

Baboon can open four kinds of source, each on a background thread so the UI
never blocks. Opening a source that is already open switches to it rather than
loading a second copy; opening a new one adds a workspace beside the existing
ones rather than replacing them:

- **Single tag** — open any individual loose tag file.
- **Loose tags folder** — point at an MCC editing-kit `tags/` directory (or the
  kit root, e.g. `H3EK`; Baboon locates the `tags` folder and identifies the
  game automatically). The folder tree is loaded **lazily**, expanding
  directories only as you open them, so even a full kit opens instantly.
- **Monolithic cache** — open a `blob_index.dat` monolithic tag cache (a Halo 4
  development build, or the Halo Reach 2011 tags build) and browse its contents
  as if they were loose files. Read-only, and big-endian — see *Importing a
  monolithic cache into an editing kit* for the way out.
- **Campaign Evolved container** — point **Load Folder** at the Halo: Campaign
  Evolved game directory (or its `Meteorite/Content/Paks`). Baboon finds the
  container directory inside the install itself, and remembers the folder you
  picked. It auto-detects the UE5 IoStore paks, mounts them as one read-only virtual filesystem, and
  presents the Reach tags exactly like loose files. Every pack (the shared base
  chunk plus the per-level chunks that carry each mission's scenario and BSPs) is
  merged into a single lowercase tag tree. See *Campaign Evolved mods* below.

Tag files are identified by probing their 64-byte header for the `BLAM`
(big-endian) / `MALB` (little-endian) magic, so non-tag files in the tree are
silently skipped.

A loose kit keeps a cached index of its tags in `%APPDATA%\Baboon`, and every
open reconciles that cache against disk in the background — a size/mtime check
per file, re-reading only the headers of files that actually changed. Both that
reconciliation and the from-scratch scan fan their per-file work out across every
core, which is roughly a 3× saving on the reconciliation for a full MCC kit
(H3EK's ~58,000 files: 4.7s → 1.7s here).

### Tag browser

- **Folder view** — the on-disk directory hierarchy, with a **per-group icon**
  beside each tag (and on its editor tab) for quick visual scanning. Double-click
  a folder to open a docked browser tab rooted at that folder, with its own
  search, folder/group view, sorting and filtering. Favorite loose folders for
  direct access from the browser's Favorites section.
- **Groups view** — tags regrouped by tag group (e.g. *biped*, *weapon*,
  *render_model*), with friendly names resolved from the definition tables.
- **Recent folders** — a quick-open list in the File menu, on the workspace
  tab bar, and on the welcome screen; entries can be removed individually or
  cleared.
- **Boolean search/filter** — a fast, memoised filter supporting space-separated
  **AND**, `|` **OR**, and `^prefix` / `suffix$` / `^exact$` anchors matched over
  the filename, group four-CC, and group name. A label flags degenerate filters
  (an empty `|` operand, an anchor-only term). Results are cached and recomputed
  only when the query, source, or mode changes — not per frame — so the tree
  stays responsive across 100k+ entry kits.
- **Sort** — order each folder/group by natural, name, or type.
- **Reveal in tree** — jump the browser to any tag (e.g. from a search result),
  force-opening its ancestors and scrolling it into view.
- **Background indexing** — a full recursive scan runs in the background to power
  Groups view and global search without expanding every node first. The
  completed index is **persisted** (per game, to `%APPDATA%\Baboon`) so
  subsequent launches skip the scan entirely.
- **Context actions** — per-tag and per-folder right-click actions for JSON dump,
  raw extraction, bitmap/geometry/animation extraction, *Rename / Move* (with
  automatic reference fix-up across every referencing tag), *Duplicate*,
  *Delete*, *Dump Tag References*, and *Open in File Explorer*.
- **Launch a scenario from the browser** — right-click any `.scenario` for *Open
  in Sapien* / *Open in tag_test*, the same two launches the tag's own header
  offers, without opening the tag first. Both follow the same rules as the
  header: Sapien is not offered at all for kits whose Sapien takes no scenario
  (Combat Evolved, Campaign Evolved), and either is greyed out when its
  executable is not in the kit.

### Duplicating & deleting tags

Right-click any tag in the browser to **Duplicate** it. The dialog edits the leaf
name only — the parent folder, tag group and extension are fixed — and validates
the name against Windows' rules and the tags already in the source before
anything is written. The copy opens in a tab and is revealed in the tree beside
the tag it came from.

- **Loose kits** — the copy is written next to the original as a new file. If the
  source tag has unsaved edits, the copy takes the edited bytes and the original
  keeps its own; a name that already exists is refused rather than overwritten.
- **Campaign Evolved** — the copy is written **into the container that serves the
  tag**, in place: the new package is appended to that container's `.ucas` and
  the `.utoc` is rewritten to address it, with a new package identity and export
  hash. This changes files the game loads, so it always confirms first, naming
  the exact pack (mod or shipped) and its `.utoc` path. The copy appears in the
  tree immediately, is searchable and openable without a reload, and is carried
  into the next exported mod as **new content** — a package of its own, not a
  field-level edit to the tag it came from.

  The `.uasset` wrapper a copy is built from is resolved from what the mount
  recorded at index time — the package index first, then the container's own
  directory entries, matched without case if need be — never by assembling a
  path from the name shown in the browser. A container's directory index is
  matched byte for byte, and a mod that ships no index has its paths *recovered*,
  so the two halves of a package do not always agree on case. Every duplicate
  logs the paths it actually used, and a failure reports them.

**Delete** removes a tag again. A loose tag is *moved*, not erased — it goes to
`%APPDATA%\Baboon\deleted-tags\<game>\<timestamp>\…` so it can be recovered by
hand. A Campaign Evolved tag is retired from its container: its chunk slots are
emptied and its package-store entry removed, without moving any other chunk.

Deleting a Campaign Evolved tag is deliberately limited to **copies Baboon
itself created**. Once a copy is in a pak it is indistinguishable from a tag the
game shipped, so eligibility comes from Baboon's own records — a duplicate
ledger in `%APPDATA%\Baboon`, and the immutable backup written beside a container
before it is first modified — never from the container. Anything the game
shipped has Delete greyed out, and the library re-checks the same evidence before
touching a byte. The confirmation lists every tag that references the one being
deleted, or says plainly when no reference index is available.

Every in-place container write takes an immutable `.utoc` backup plus a manifest
beside the pak first, and reports the result — including the backup path — in a
dialog that stays until dismissed. A failed write restores the container and
changes nothing.

### Chimp — the Campaign Evolved package workspace

Campaign Evolved's tags are cooked into UE5 packages, and some of what the game
loads is not a tag at all. **Chimp** is a second workspace inside a loaded
Campaign Evolved kit for working on those packages directly, rather than forcing
Unreal concepts through the tag model. Switch to it from the workspace surface
toggle; it shares the kit's Paks root but keeps its own package index, documents
and editor state.

- Browse every cooked package in the mounted containers, by folder tree, by
  filter, or by type.
- Edit reflected properties against the game's schema (`.usmap`), with typed
  values, containers, and structs resolved to their real names.
- Preview textures, static meshes and skeletal meshes. Textures use the same
  viewer as `bitmap` tags, stepping through every mip level and — on a virtual
  texture with more than one layer — every layer. Campaign Evolved ships most of
  its art as UE5 virtual textures; those are reassembled from their tiles,
  borders removed, with the UDIM blocks laid out side by side. A base mip larger
  than the display can upload is noted and the largest mip that fits is shown
  instead; export is unaffected.
- **Extract Texture2D** — one menu entry that asks which image format first,
  then where to save. DDS, TIFF and PNG all split a UDIM virtual
  texture into `name.1001.…`, `name.1002.…`, … following the UDIM convention,
  ready to import back into Unreal as a UDIM set, and all three give each block
  the resolution it was authored at — a set that mixes 2048 and 1024 blocks
  exports each at its own size rather than magnifying the smaller ones. DDS
  additionally keeps the cooked pixel format (BC1–BC7 and the uncompressed
  formats) and the whole mip chain, so it is the bytes the game ships rather
  than a re-encode; TIFF and PNG are one flat RGBA8 image per block. Splitting
  can be turned off, writing the whole set as the single stitched image its
  tiles were reassembled into, for an engine with no UDIM support — blocks
  authored smaller are magnified onto the same grid, so it costs some of the
  detail splitting keeps.
- Extracting a static or skeletal mesh offers its textures alongside it — either
  every texture the materials reference, or just the ones named after the model —
  and asks the same image-format question, so they land beside the mesh in
  whichever format you picked rather than always TIFF.
- **Header** — the package's own tables as editable rows: the name map, the
  import map, the export map, and the package's flags and versioning. Every name
  and import slot shows what references it, because a name is stored as an index
  and renaming one entry retargets every reference to it at once — so the count
  is the blast radius. Editing a name also refreshes the resolved text inside
  decoded properties, which is what stops a later edit forking a second entry
  rather than following the rename. Import slots retarget to another script
  object or package export, and can be added but never removed: object
  properties name a slot by position, so dropping one would shift every
  reference above it. The package's own name is not editable here — the
  container addresses the chunk serving a package by a hash of that string, so
  moving it is a rename of the package rather than an edit of the table.
  Changing an export's object flags re-reads the export and refuses the change
  if the payload no longer decodes, because those flags decide how the bytes are
  read and not merely how they are labelled. Flags and versioning are written
  and read back before they are applied, and refused if anything did not
  survive; the versioning fields are Expert mode only, and are not stored at all
  while a package is unversioned — which every shipped Campaign Evolved package
  is.
- Save edited packages back into the container in place, or bundle them into a
  mod container.
- Edits are checkpointed to a recovery folder, so a crash or a restart does not
  lose work in progress.

### Search, navigation & cross-referencing

- **Find in fields (`Ctrl+F`)** — search field values, labels, or both in the
  current tag, all open tags, or the complete loaded source. Every matching
  substring is highlighted, and previous/next navigation reveals the matching
  field and selects the required nested block element.
- **Field-value search** — search across tags' *field values* (not just names),
  run on a background worker against an in-memory field index and optionally
  scoped to a tag group; results open in a clickable window.
- **Find references** — list every tag that references the current tag; click a
  result to open it and **jump straight to the exact field** where the reference
  lives (ancestor blocks expanded, the field scrolled into view and briefly
  glowed). When a tag references the target in more than one place, an expander
  under its row lists every occurrence, each individually clickable.
- **Content Explorer** — a reference-graph navigator centred on one tag: who
  references it (parents) and what it references (children), with back/forward
  history and a filter box.
- **Dump Tag References** — right-click a tag to write everything it pulls in,
  recursively, to a text file: an indented tree of the whole dependency
  subtree. Tag graphs contain cycles and shared leaves, so a tag already listed
  is marked `(see above)` rather than expanded twice, and a dependency with no
  tag behind it is marked `(missing)`. Needs the reference index.
- **Unreferenced tags** — scan for tags that nothing else points at.
- **Keyword tagging** — attach freeform keywords to tags (stored in a per-game
  sidecar, outside the tags) and browse or filter by them.
- **Scenario map IDs** — list scenario map IDs across the kit.
- **Tag Diff** — compare the current tag field-by-field against another open tab
  *or* any tag on disk; differences (changed values and block element-count
  mismatches) show in a table and export as TSV.

### Multiple games at once

Each loaded source is a **workspace** with its own browser, its own open tags,
its own indexes, and its own undo history, shown as a tab across the top of the
window.

- The **+** on the workspace tab bar opens another game, including from the
  recent folders list.
- **Drag a workspace tab** against the edge of a pane to split the window and
  work in two games side by side, each with its own browser.
- Closing a workspace prompts for anything unsaved in it, and closing Baboon
  prompts for every workspace that has unsaved work.
- With nothing loaded, the editor shows a **welcome screen** listing the open
  actions, your configured editing kits, and recent folders — each of which can
  be removed individually or cleared.

### Tabbed, splittable editor

- Open multiple tags as **tabs**, each with its group icon and an amber tint +
  ● marker when it has unsaved edits.
- **Split** the editor by dragging a tab against the edge of a pane, and view
  two tags side by side. Drag a tab onto another group to move it.
- Open **several games at once**: each is a workspace tab with its own browser
  and its own tags, and dragging a workspace tab splits the window between two
  games.
- **Right-click a tab** to reveal that tag in the browser tree, or to close all
  tabs / all tabs but this one.
- When a tab bar overflows, **scroll the mouse wheel over it** to move along it
  (up = left, down = right) — on the editor's tag tabs and the workspace tabs
  alike — alongside the arrow buttons that appear at its ends.
- **`Ctrl+W`** closes the current tab, prompting first if it has unsaved edits.
  On the Chimp surface it closes the selected package instead.
- Tabs remain open until explicitly closed; the practical document limit is
  available memory. Drag a tab against a pane edge to split the editor and view
  two tags at once.

### Field editing

The editor renders the full tag structure — nested blocks, arrays, structs, and
pageable resources — with inline editing for loose little-endian tags:

- Scalars, integers, reals, strings, and `string_id`s.
- **Enums** and **bit flags** with named options.
- **Colors** via an interactive color-picker popup with channel parsing.
- **Tag references** with an *Open* button (Alt-click opens in a split beside
  the current pane)
  that resolves and opens the referenced tag — even if it isn't in the current
  index — an *Import* button on geometry references that re-imports the source
  asset via `tool`, **drag-and-drop** from the browser to set a reference (the
  same drag can leave Baboon and land on Sapien; see *Tool launchers*), and a
  red highlight when a referenced tag is missing on disk.
- **Block-index fields** render as a dropdown of the target block's elements
  (with a leading `<none>`) plus a "go to" button to the referenced element.
- **Field documentation** — help text, units, and value ranges (recovered from
  the JSON schemas, since shipped tags strip them) shown on hover, plus Foundation-
  style **explanation blocks** inline.
- **Undo / redo** — every edit (field, block, structural) is journaled;
  `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` and the Edit menu step through the history.
- **Guerilla-style "Search fields"** — type a block or field name to filter the
  editor down to just the matching fields and the blocks/structs/arrays that
  contain them; everything else is hidden. Available on every field-tree tag,
  including sound tags. Use the jump button or press Enter repeatedly to cycle
  through matching rows; the search stays active until cleared. Each visible
  block also has a jump button that clears the filter and anchors that block in
  the full editor. Blocks and structs keep their expand state as you page
  through a block's elements, and structs are expanded by default.
- **Angle units** — `angle`, `angle_bounds` and both euler types hold radians on
  disk and are shown and typed in **degrees**, as Guerilla and the other Halo
  tools do. *View ▸ Angles in degrees* (also in *Settings ▸ Appearance*) turns
  that off to read and edit the stored radians instead. Field search, TSV
  copy/paste and the tag diff all follow the same setting, so a round trip never
  changes units halfway.
- **Expert mode** toggle to reveal advanced/normally-hidden fields.
- Monolithic-cache and big-endian tags are opened **read-only**; only
  little-endian loose tags can be saved back to disk.

### Block & array editing

Full structural editing of tag blocks, applied safely after each frame's render
pass:

- **Add**, **insert**, **duplicate**, and **delete** elements, plus **delete
  all** (with a confirmation modal for destructive ops). Fixed-size **arrays**
  omit the count-changing actions but support copy and in-place replace.
- **Copy / paste** elements — including the entire block — between two open tags
  of the same group, with compatibility re-validated by the library before
  insertion.
- **Replace** a selected element or an entire block from the clipboard.
- **Copy block as TSV** / **Paste TSV** — round-trip a block's leaf fields
  through tab-separated rows (e.g. via a spreadsheet).
- **Breadcrumb / jump-to-parent** — a `↑` control on nested blocks scrolls back
  to the parent block, with the path shown on hover.

### Shader & material editor

For `shader`, `material`, and `material_shader` tags, Baboon builds a
**Guerilla-style shader grid** instead of a raw field dump:

- Resolves the tag's render-method definition (`rmdf`) and options (`rmop`),
  caching them across tags.
- Shows bitmap, scalar, integer, color, and category parameters with their
  defaults, all editable inline.
- **Inline bitmap thumbnails** on bitmap-reference rows, with an enlarged
  preview on hover (works for classic Halo 1/2 bitmaps too).
- **Differs-from-default** indicator (an accent bar on changed rows) and a
  right-click **Reset to default**.
- **Resizable** label column (drag the divider) and the full parameter name +
  type shown on hover.
- Add optional **animated parameters** (e.g. bitmap transforms) from a context
  menu, and edit their animation **functions**.

### Function editor

An interactive editor for tag mapping functions (`TagFunction`), supporting the
editable function types — *identity*, *constant*, *linear*, and *linear key* —
with curve points, color graphs, input/range `string_id` selection (seeded with
common inputs like *time*, *frame*, *random*, *shield vitality*), and a
hex-blob round-trip channel that preserves arbitrary function data losslessly.

### Bitmap preview

For `bitmap` tags, a built-in texture viewer:

- Decodes the bitmap to RGBA (via `blam-tags`' bitmap decoder).
- **Image (sequence) and mip-level selectors** — step through every image in a
  multi-image bitmap and every mipmap level (the dimensions update accordingly).
- Per-channel **R / G / B / A** toggles, including alpha-only inspection.
- **Zoom-to-cursor**, **drag-to-pan**, zoom presets (25–400 % / fit), and a
  background-colour toggle behind transparent images.
- Under-cursor **pixel coordinate + RGBA readout**.
- Reports format, type, dimensions, and image count.

### Bitmap Browser

*Tools ▸ Assets ▸ Bitmap Browser* opens a **Bitmap Library** tab listing every
bitmap in the workspace as a thumbnail grid.

- **Search** by name with the tag browser's own filter grammar — space is AND,
  `|` is OR, `^foo` / `foo$` / `^foo$` anchor to the name — so typing `grass`
  narrows to the grass textures and `grass | metal` covers both.
- **Size slider** scales the grid from thumbnails to large previews.
- **Double-click** a thumbnail to open that bitmap tag in its own tab.
- **Right-click** a thumbnail to *Extract bitmap images…* — the same TIFF
  extraction the browser tree offers, without leaving the grid.
- **Drag a thumbnail** onto a shader's bitmap slot, or any Foundation tag-
  reference cell, to set that reference — the same drag the browser tree
  supports. Drag the *Bitmap Library* tab against a pane edge first to split the
  editor, so the library and the shader are visible side by side.
- Thumbnails decode on background threads, only for the cells actually on
  screen, and from the smallest mip level that still fills the cell — so a kit
  with thousands of bitmaps scrolls without stalling the UI. The decoded set is
  capped and evicts least-recently-shown first, rather than growing without
  bound.
- On a loose editing kit the browser needs the full background index to see
  every folder, and asks for it on open if it has not run yet.
- **Left open, it comes back.** A workspace that had the Bitmap Library open
  reopens it on the next session restore, alongside that workspace's tags. It
  travels with its own workspace, so opening it in one game does not open it in
  another.

### Model Browser

*Tools ▸ Assets ▸ Model Browser* opens a **Model Library** tab listing every
render model in the workspace (`render_model`, and Halo CE `gbxmodel`) as a
thumbnail grid.

- **Thumbnails are real geometry** — each render model is rasterized
  flat-shaded on a background thread, in the same pose the editor's 3D preview
  opens with.
- **Search** with the tag browser's own filter grammar and a **size slider**,
  exactly as in the Bitmap Library.
- **Double-click** a thumbnail to open the **`.model` that owns it** — resolved
  by the sibling-path convention — falling back to the render model itself when
  no `.model` exists beside it (Halo CE gbxmodels always open themselves).
  **Right-click** offers the render model tag directly.
- **Drag a thumbnail** onto any tag-reference cell to set that reference.
- Same bounded thumbnail cache, visible-cells-only decode, background-index
  request, and session-restore behavior as the Bitmap Library.

### Model preview

For `model` (`hlmt`), `render_model` (`mode`), `collision_model`,
`physics_model`, `scenario_structure_bsp`, and `scenario` tags, a real-time 3D
preview:

- **Orbit / pan / zoom camera** built for levels as much as props: panning
  moves the orbit point in world space, so the camera orbits and zooms around
  whatever was framed; scrolling **zooms toward the cursor**; the zoom range
  runs 0.02–500× on a logarithmic slider. An optional **Perspective**
  projection replaces the default orthographic one — matched exactly at the
  orbit point, so toggling never jumps.
- `.model` tags can overlay their referenced **collision model** (orange) and
  **physics model** (blue) over the render model, posed on the same skeleton,
  with a **Render** toggle to view the overlays alone. `collision_model` and
  `physics_model` tags preview the same geometry standalone — physics spheres,
  boxes, pills, and convex hulls are tessellated from the tag's parametric
  shapes.
- **Structure BSPs** preview their full render geometry — textured on the
  Halo 3 family, through the same shader pipeline as models — with the sealed
  collision BSP and cluster portals as separately toggleable layers.
- **Scenarios** preview a composite of their structure BSPs: a checkbox per
  entry in the `structure bsps` block loads that BSP's render geometry, and
  each loaded BSP becomes its own region toggle.
- **Textured shading** (Halo 3 and Reach) — each mesh part is drawn with its own
  shader's maps, resolved through the render_model's materials: **diffuse**,
  **detail** (tiling at the shader's own scale), **normal**, and a **detail
  normal** blended over it, plus alpha-test cutouts. A *Shaded* toggle drops
  back to the flat per-material colours, which stay useful for reading
  silhouette and topology. Textures resolve on a worker and the viewport waits
  for them, so a model never appears untextured and then changes.
- **Variant selector** — switch between the model's named variants and see the
  per-region permutation set applied; region/permutation choices can be tweaked
  and synced back to the variant.
- **Marker overlay** with a name filter, and a loading indicator while geometry
  resolves.
- Edit `render_model` **marker fields and names** inline.

### Sound playback

For `sound` (`snd!`) tags, an in-editor player auditions the tag's audio without
leaving Baboon — decoded in pure Rust by `blam-tags` and played through
[`rodio`](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio). Baboon resolves each game's audio
storage automatically:

- **Halo CE** — inline Ogg Vorbis on each permutation.
- **Halo 2** — inline Opus, Xbox-IMA-ADPCM (mono / stereo / quad), or PCM, per
  the tag's compression and encoding.
- **Halo 3 / Reach** — FMOD-Vorbis subsounds paged out to the kit's FMOD banks
  (`<game>/fmod/pc/*.fsb`), resolved by permutation name.
- **Halo 4** — Wwise: the tag's event name is resolved through the game's sound
  packages (`<game>/sound/pc/*.pck`) — event → action → sound / container →
  media — and the referenced Wwise-Vorbis audio is rebuilt to Ogg and decoded.

A **play button per permutation** (or per event for Halo 4), a **Stop** control,
and a status line showing the current clip and its duration. Decoded audio is
cached, and the banks / packages are opened lazily on first play.

### Cross-game tag overviews

Curated summary panels for tags that are otherwise tedious as raw field dumps,
resolving the layout differences across kits:

- **material_effects**, **dialogue**, and **sound_classes** overview tables, with
  clickable references that jump to the related tags.

### Importing tags from another game

**File → Import Tags…**, or right-click any folder in the browser and choose
**Import tags here…**, brings tags in from another game's editing kit and
converts them to the kit you have open.

- Point it at **one tag** or at a **folder** — a folder pulls in everything
  beneath it, subfolders and all, recreating the same shape at the destination.
- Give it the path however suits: the **Choose tag…** / **Choose folder…**
  pickers, or paste a path straight into the box (quotes from Explorer's *Copy
  as path* are fine).
- Baboon works out **which game the tags came from** — from the editing kit they
  live in, or failing that from the tag's own header and layout — and says how
  it decided. Correct it from the dropdown when the guess is wrong.
- A single tag shows a **preview before anything is written**: what copied
  exactly, what was converted, what the target left at its defaults, and every
  reference you will need to reconnect by hand.
- The **file extension follows the target group**, not the source: a Reach
  `.shader` imported into Halo 4 is written as a `.material`.

- When a pair **cannot** carry a tag directly, Baboon routes it through the
  engines in between rather than refusing. A Halo 2 bitmap has nowhere to put its
  pixels in Reach, so it goes by way of Halo 3 — and the report names the route
  it took. Nothing is written along the way: each hop hands the next the bytes a
  save would have produced, so there is no intermediate tag left in a kit and a
  failed hop leaves no debris.

Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, ODST, Reach, Halo 4 and H2A convert between each other
in any direction; Campaign Evolved pairs with Reach only, in both directions (and
is never a waypoint — a tag cannot reach it by way of Reach). Where a tag system
was genuinely replaced between engines the report says so rather than quietly
nulling the fields — see
[`docs/tag-conversion-mappings.md`](docs/tag-conversion-mappings.md).

### Importing a monolithic cache into an editing kit

An Xbox 360 tag build (`tag_cache/blob_index.dat`) holds big-endian tags no
editing kit can open. Right-click a folder in one and choose **Import into
editing kit…** to convert the lot into an open loose kit.

- Tags land at **their own paths** — `objects\characters\elite` in the build
  becomes `<kit>\tags\objects\characters\elite`. That is what keeps references
  working: a reference carries the path the build gave it, so a tag written
  anywhere else would be pointed at by nothing. **Or somewhere you pick** —
  under *Where*, choose a folder and the import lands there instead, keeping
  its shape below the folder you asked for: `objects\weapons` into `scratch`
  puts the rifle's bitmaps at `scratch\rifle\bitmaps`. The window says what
  that costs — nothing rewrites references, so the tags pointing at these will
  not find them.
- **You decide what gets replaced.** Under *Tags the kit already has*: replace
  them, keep them, or pick. Picking scans the destination and lists what is
  already there as the same folder tree — tick a branch or a single tag. Untick
  one and it is left exactly as the kit has it, and the report says which ones
  were kept. Replacing is still the default, which is what a kit being filled
  from a build wants; keeping is what a kit you have worked in wants.
- **It brings the folder, then asks about the rest.** Nothing outside the
  folder is converted behind your back. When the tags that landed point at
  something the kit does not have, the run reports it as a folder tree you can
  open — tick a whole branch, or go down to the individual tag — and a second
  run fetches what you ticked. Anything left unticked stays out, and the tags
  pointing at it keep a reference the kit cannot resolve.
- **One tag at a time, too.** Right-click a tag in a cache and *Import into
  editing kit…* converts just that one, either at its own path or at a folder
  you choose — one tag keeps only its name, rather than the folders above it.
  It still reports what the tag reached for.
- **Pixels and geometry come across.** A 360 bitmap arrives whole — every mip
  level, every cube face and array layer — un-tiled out of its texture
  resources and byte-swapped into the shared `processed pixel data` blob a PC
  tag reads. Formats the PC build ships decoded (`ctx1`, `dxn_mono_alpha`, the
  `dxt3a`/`dxt5a` family) are decoded on the way. A render model's vertex and
  index buffers arrive as the inline author-format blocks an MCC tag stores,
  and the meshes stop describing GPU buffers that did not come with them.
- **Lightmaps too.** A level's lightmap textures describe their images only in
  the tag's 360 mirror, so the PC image block is built from it — which is what
  a kit's own copy of the same texture holds. The lightmap BSP data comes
  across whole wherever the build actually has it.
- **Sounds, scenarios and BSPs come too.** A sound's samples do not cross, and
  do not need to — MCC Reach's own sounds name an FMOD bank rather than
  carrying audio, so a converted sound finds its audio by name and one the kit
  has no bank for is silent. A BSP's structure resource does cross: the
  collision hierarchy and the instanced geometry definitions are read out of
  the build's own control data and written where a loose tag keeps them, so
  the instances have something to point at.
- **Animations come across too.** A graph keeps its animations in a pageable
  resource, which a 360 build stores as the engine had it in memory rather than
  as the inline members a loose tag holds. They are read out of that and
  written back in the kit's shape, with every codec stream — quantized,
  keyframe and curve alike — put into this side's byte order.
- **What cannot cross is held back, not written empty.** A class your kit ships
  no example of is the main one: a tag built from the schema alone is one the
  kit's own loader refuses, so it is reported instead of landing broken.
- References naming a tag the build itself no longer holds are reported
  separately: those were already broken in the source. A build is a working
  store rather than an archive, so its index can name a tag it kept no bytes
  for — most of a 2011 Reach build's lightmap BSP data is like that — and those
  are reported in the same words rather than as a parse failure.
- **A level with no lightmap is called out on its own.** A `scenario_lightmap_bsp_data`
  the build kept no bytes for is not one failed tag among hundreds: Sapien will
  not open a level whose lighting is missing, and the error it gives names the
  BSP and never mentions lighting. The run lists those levels and says what it
  means.
- The run has a **Cancel** button. A whole build's worth of tags is a long job,
  and everything written before you stop it stays written.

Halo 4 development caches and the Halo Reach 2011 tags build are both this
format. The destination profile is the kit you pick; a big-endian source is the
one case where a profile converts to *itself*, because the byte order — and
usually the schema revision — really do differ.

### Custom color palettes

Save colours picked in the color editor and build reusable Baboon palettes that
can be loaded back in any tag — handy for keeping shader/material colours
consistent.

### Export & extraction

All extraction runs on background threads and reports progress to the status bar:

- **JSON dump** — a single tag or an entire folder subtree to pretty-printed
  JSON, preserving the full field hierarchy (blocks, arrays, structs, enums,
  flags, references, resources).
- **Raw tag extraction** — write a tag (e.g. one pulled from a monolithic cache)
  back out as a standalone loose tag file.
- **Bitmap extraction** — every image in a bitmap tag to **TIFF**, individually
  or in bulk across a folder.
- **Geometry extraction** — to **JMS** / **ASS**:
  - `model` (`hlmt`) — resolves and extracts the referenced render, collision,
    and physics models, sharing the render skeleton across them, into
    `render/`, `collision/`, and `physics/` subfolders.
  - `render_model` (`mode`), `collision_model` (`coll`), `physics_model`
    (`phmo`) — direct JMS extraction.
  - `scenario_structure_bsp` (`sbsp`) — ASS extraction.
  - `scenario` (`scnr`) — per-BSP geometry extraction (ASS for Halo 2/3,
    render + collision JMS for Halo CE).
- **Import info** and **animation extraction**, all run in-process via the
  `blam-tags` library.

### Halo: Campaign Evolved mods

Campaign Evolved's tags live inside UE5 IoStore paks. Baboon edits them **in
memory**, and exporting a mod is the way changes are committed:

- **Save** (Ctrl+S) — your change is already kept in the workspace's stash, so
  Save opens the **Export Mod** review rather than writing anything into the
  game. The installed paks are never touched. *(Loose-folder MCC tags save
  normally.)*
- **Export Mod…** (File menu) — bundle **every modified tag in the active
  project**, including checkpointed tags whose tabs were closed, into one
  portable, higher-priority **overlay container** without touching the base game.
  Mods are fully reversible (delete the overlay to uninstall).
- **Overwriting the game's own paks** is available in **Expert mode** only. With
  it on, Save writes the tag back into its container in place: the edited chunk
  is appended to the `.ucas` and the `.utoc` is rewritten to point at it
  (preserving the container's perfect-hash seeds), with the paired `.uasset`'s
  bulk-data size patched when an edit changes the tag's byte length. This
  modifies the shipped game files, so Baboon **confirms first** — with a *Don't
  ask again* option under **Settings → Startup → Saving** — and there is no undo
  without a backup of the paks. Chimp's *Overwrite source PAKs* mode is gated the
  same way.
- **Save As** — *duplicate* the tag under a new name into an overlay container (a
  new UE package with its own identity, `.uasset`, and container-header entry).
- **Rename** (right-click) — the same as Save As, plus a package **redirect** so
  existing tags that reference the old name resolve to the renamed one.
- **Duplicate / Delete** (right-click) — add a copy to, or retire one from, the
  container itself rather than an overlay. See *Duplicating & deleting tags*.
- **Extract All Tags to Folder…** (File menu, **Expert mode** only) — write every
  tag the mounted containers ship into a folder on disk, laid out like an editing
  kit (`levels/…`, `objects/…`, `shaders/…`, with friendly group extensions), so
  the tag set can be diffed, grepped, handed to other tools, or reopened with
  **Load Folder**. The `.ubulk` payloads are already byte-complete tags, so they
  are copied out untouched — no parse, no re-serialize. This extracts what the
  game **ships**: a mod mounted over a tag is ignored, and tags that only a mod
  provides are counted as skipped. It is tens of thousands of decompressed reads
  and file writes, so it confirms first, reports progress in the status bar, and
  can be cancelled from there; Baboon stays usable while it runs.
- **Extract tags to folder…** (right-click a folder in the browser) — the same
  extraction aimed at one folder instead of the whole workspace, and **not**
  Expert-gated: the scope is bounded and deliberately chosen. The count in the
  menu is what actually gets written — tags authored this session have no shipped
  payload to read, so they are excluded from it rather than promised and skipped.
  Tags keep their **full** paths, so the result lands under `objects/characters/…`
  inside the folder you pick and several folder extractions into one destination
  merge into a single **Load Folder**-able kit. Offered in *Folders* mode only: a
  *Groups* node is a group label rather than a folder, and the on-disk layout
  follows the tags' own paths, so the result would not resemble the node clicked.

Any in-place write to a container **drops that pak's perfect-hash lookup table**.
The table maps a chunk id to a *slot* in the chunk-id array, so both the chunk
count and every chunk's position are part of it — adding an entry changes the
modulo base for every chunk in the container, and there is no way to regenerate
the table. Dropping it makes the runtime index chunk ids directly instead, which
is exactly how the overlay containers Baboon exports are already laid out. The
cost is a slightly slower mount for that one pak; the alternative is a container
whose lookups silently stop resolving.

Export Mod writes into the folder you pick, and **only** that folder — the mod
name names the files, never a directory. It defaults to the game's own
`Meteorite/Content/Paks/~mods`, created for you if it does not exist, so the
ordinary export installs itself where it lands with nothing to copy. The review
window lists the exact four files it is about to write before you commit to it.

The mod is built at a staging path with every container still mapped, and only
swapped over the files already there once it is complete — so a failed export
leaves the installed mod exactly as it was. Replacing a mod this workspace has
mounted works too: Baboon releases its own mappings and the Unreal package
workspace's open handles first, then remounts and reindexes afterwards, keeping
your open tabs and edits. If something else still holds the container open, the
refusal names the file, the step it failed at, and what it can identify as still
holding it rather than asking you to try again.

Export Mod produces a `<name>_P` IoStore **triplet** — `.utoc`, `.ucas`, and a
small `.pak` stub — plus a same-stem `.baboon` project file containing the
open-tab layout and recoverable copies of every modified/new tag. Use
**File → Open Baboon Project…** to continue editing that project on this or
another machine. Save As / Rename produce the IoStore triplet without a project
sidecar. If you exported somewhere other than the game's own `~mods`, drop **all
three runtime files** into `Meteorite/Content/Paks/~mods/` (or `Paks/` itself).
The `.pak` is required: UE's loader discovers containers by scanning that folder
for `.pak` files and derives the matching `.utoc`/`.ucas` from each — an overlay
with no `.pak` is never mounted. The `_P` suffix then gives the overlay patch
priority so UE serves your chunks on top of the base (last-mounted-wins).

While a Campaign Evolved source is open, Baboon checkpoints the active project
to `%APPDATA%\Baboon\campaign_evolved_recovery.baboon` after a short idle
period. A project stores the **session**, not just the files: which tags were
open and in what order, which was selected, the edited bytes of every modified
or newly-created tag, and each open tag's **undo/redo history** — so reopening a
workspace picks up where you left off, including the steps behind an edit. Clean
tabs reload from the game containers. The normal Ask / Always / Never session
setting controls whether this recovery project is reopened on the next launch.

History is capped well below what is kept in memory — the most recent 16 steps
per stack, within a 64 MiB budget shared across the whole workspace, oldest
dropped first — because one step is a whole serialized tag and Campaign Evolved
ships a 105 MiB animation graph. It is written to your own recovery and project
files only, **never** to the `.baboon` beside an exported mod: that file is
downloaded by whoever installs the mod, and your editing trail is neither their
business nor their bandwidth.

Tag identity (`FPackageId` / export hashes), UE5 Zen-package `.uasset`
(de)serialization, and override-container writing are all implemented natively in
`blam-tags` with no external UE tooling — references resolve by the same
`CityHash64` package-path hashing the game itself uses. Output containers are
validated structurally against an independent packer; loading them in the
shipping game is the one step that requires a Windows/Xbox run to confirm.

### Geometry import & integrated terminal

- An **Import** button on geometry/animation references runs the matching `tool`
  verb (`render` / `collision` / `physics` / `model-animations-uncompressed`)
  against the source asset.
- An integrated **terminal panel** runs commands in the editing-kit root with
  live streamed output. Its open/closed state is remembered **per editing kit**.

### Tool launchers & command runner

Toolbar buttons launch the loaded kit's tools, with the executable auto-detected
per game:

- **Sapien** (`sapien.exe`).
- **tag_test** — the game-specific build (`halo_tag_test.exe`,
  `halo2_tag_test.exe`, `halo3_tag_test.exe`, `atlas_tag_test.exe`,
  `reach_tag_test.exe`, `halo4_tag_test.exe`, or the generic `tag_test.exe`).
- **Blender** — at a user-configured path (set in *File → Settings*).

Launchers are disabled until the relevant executable is found in the kit.

When a loose `.scenario` tag is open, its editor header also provides Sapien and
tag_test buttons, and the same two are on the tag's right-click menu in the
browser. Baboon saves pending edits and passes the absolute scenario
file directly to Sapien. **Halo: Combat Evolved has no Sapien button at all** —
that kit's Sapien takes no scenario on its command line, so there is no way to
open one in it, and a control that can never work is not offered greyed out.
Campaign Evolved has no Sapien to launch either. Combat Evolved keeps its
tag_test button; every other kit keeps both. The tag_test
launcher updates the kit's `init.txt` while preserving unrelated commands. The
quick-access launchers remain generic, and quick-access tag_test removes stale
active scenario-launch commands from `init.txt`.

**Drag a tag into Sapien.** Drag an object tag (a weapon, vehicle, biped,
crate, scenery, equipment, machine, and so on) out of the browser and let go
over a running Sapien window. Baboon hands Sapien the file the same way Windows
Explorer does, and Sapien adds it to the scenario's matching palette. While the
drag hovers Sapien the cursor shows a copy or not-allowed sign and the status
bar names the palette; after the drop it reports the hand-over. The same drop
opens the tag in Guerilla. Only a tag on disk inside that Sapien's own editing
kit can go, and only one whose group has a palette in that game's scenario (a
bitmap from a loaded kit is refused before Sapien sees it). Drop on Sapien's
main window: its Hierarchy, Properties and Output windows take no files, and
Baboon says which window to use instead. Halo CE's and Halo 2's Sapien take no
dropped files at all, so Baboon says so instead of pretending; use *Edit Types*
in Sapien for those.

A **Run Tool Command** window lists each game's `tool` commands (from per-game
JSON), with a form for their parameters — enum dropdowns, file/path pickers, and
**inline validation** that flags empty required parameters before running. The
assembled command runs in the integrated terminal.

A **Blam!** pane (*Tools → Blam!*, Halo 3 kits only for now) fronts Baboon's
own import pipelines instead of the kit's `tool.exe`. It opens as a tab in the
workspace's editor area — like the Bitmap Library, it can be dragged into a
split, resized, and rearranged like any open tag. Point it at an asset's
data folder and it detects which tool source folders are there — `render`
(render_model, with an optional PRT pass), `collision` (collision_model),
`physics` (physics_model), and `structure` (structure_bsp) — ticking the
pipelines it found and disabling the ones with no source folder. A single
Import button runs everything ticked on a worker thread: each JMS becomes its
tag named after the asset folder (`tags\<asset>\<asset>.render_model`, …), and
every `.ass` in `structure` becomes its own `scenario_structure_bsp` named
after the file, since a level can carry several BSPs. Ticking **Calculate PRT
data** solves ambient PRT (64 rays a vertex) during the render import; leaving
it unticked writes every mesh as No PRT. Built tags are serialised and parsed
back before they reach disk, appear in the browser immediately, and replace
any open document so the editor shows what is now on disk. The status bar
reports each pipeline's outcome — mesh/region/material counts, or the reason
it failed — and a resizable **log window** narrates every step as it happens:
which file is parsing, its vertex/triangle counts, the PRT solve, the write,
and each pipeline's timing, with successes in green and failures in red.
Merging several JMS files in one folder is not supported yet: the
importer takes the folder's only JMS, or the one named after the asset.

### Preferences

Browser mode, prefix display, expert mode, angle units, dark/light theme, the Blender path,
custom editing-kit folder names, recent folders, keyword and palette sidecars,
and per-kit terminal state are persisted to `%APPDATA%\Baboon` and restored on
launch.

On launch Baboon can reopen the windows from your previous session. **Every
workspace** is restored, each with its own tags and its own project, and the
reopen prompt lists them grouped by game. The startup behaviour is a three-way
choice in *File → Settings* — **Ask** which windows to reopen, **Always** reopen
automatically, or **Never** — and the prompt itself carries a *Don't ask again*
option (OK remembers *Always*, Cancel remembers *Never*).

The main native window's last normal bounds and its distinct normal, maximized,
or fullscreen mode are stored separately in a versioned `window-state.json`:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Baboon\config\window-state.json`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/baboon/window-state.json` (or
  `~/.config/baboon/window-state.json`)
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Baboon/window-state.json`

Baboon restores this state before creating the first visible viewport. Saved
bounds are checked against the connected displays and their work areas, then
clamped or centered on the primary display if necessary. Portable mode does not
redirect this machine-specific file. On Wayland, portable APIs generally do
not expose absolute window positions or desktop work areas; Baboon still
restores size and mode, uses full monitor bounds for validation, and leaves
placement to the compositor when coordinates are unavailable.

## Technical overview

- **Language / edition** — Rust 2024.
- **UI** — [`eframe`/`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui) (immediate-mode GUI) with the `glow` (OpenGL)
  backend and bundled default fonts. Native file dialogs via [`rfd`](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/rfd).
- **Engine** — the [`blam-tags`](https://github.com/camden-smallwood/blam-tags) crate, pulled as a pinned Cargo git dependency,
  provides all binary tag parsing/serialisation, bitmap decoding, geometry
  export (JMS/ASS), render-method handling, sound-tag audio decoding (all games,
  via its `audio` feature), the monolithic cache reader, and — via its `iostore`
  feature — UE5 container reading, Zen-package (de)serialisation, and the
  in-place container edits behind Campaign Evolved duplicate/delete and Chimp.
  It is currently pinned to the `codex/chimp-backend` branch of the
  [`Zoephie/blam-tags`](https://github.com/Zoephie/blam-tags) fork, which carries
  those container-writing changes ahead of upstream.
- **Concurrency** — all file I/O (loading, scanning, indexing, export) runs on
  worker threads that communicate with the UI via an `mpsc` channel and request
  repaints; the UI thread never blocks on disk.
- **Caching & performance** — lazy folder-tree expansion, a memoised search-match
  tree keyed on a source generation counter, an LRU parsed-tag cache, and a
  persisted per-game entry index on disk whose reconciliation and full scan both
  run across every core.
- **Container writes** — every write to a mounted IoStore container goes through
  a lease that takes the container out of service, drops the mappings and handles
  Baboon holds on it (its own, and the Unreal package workspace's, across every
  open workspace), performs the write, then remounts and reindexes. Truncating
  writes build at a staging path and swap; appending writes keep their mappings,
  because the engine's in-place writer reads through them. Failures name the
  file, the phase, and whatever can be identified as still holding the container.
- **Platform** — primarily Windows (release builds run as a windowed app with no
  console; the app icon is embedded as a Win32 resource via `build.rs`).
  *Open in File Explorer* and the bundled tool launchers are Windows-specific;
  the core editor is platform-neutral.
- **Dependencies** — `eframe`, `egui_extras` (SVG tag icons), `image`
  (icon/bitmap handling), `flate2`, `rfd` (dialogs), `rodio` (audio output),
  `walkdir` (folder scanning), `serde_json` (JSON dump & index/prefs), `anyhow`.

## Building

Clone the repo with submodules (required for the tag definitions):

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Zoephie/Baboon.git
cd Baboon
```

Or, after a normal clone:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then build:

```
cargo build --release
```

`blam-tags` is fetched automatically by Cargo — you do not need to clone it
separately. The `definitions/` git submodule is required; initialise it with
`git submodule update --init` after cloning. The build script copies that
submodule folder next to the built executable under `target/<profile>/definitions`.

Geometry, animation, and import-info extraction all run in-process via the
`blam-tags` library — Baboon no longer shells out to a companion binary.
Ship `Baboon.exe` and the `definitions/` folder in releases.

---

## Usage

Use the **File** menu to open a single tag, a loose tags folder (e.g. an MCC
editing-kit `tags/` directory), or a Halo 4 monolithic cache (`blob_index.dat`).
Browse or search in the left panel, click a tag to open it in a tab, and edit
inline. Save loose little-endian tags back to disk from the editor. The toolbar
buttons launch the kit's Sapien / tag_test and Blender.

Tags can also be opened from a terminal by passing an editing-kit flag followed
by one or more tag paths:

```text
Baboon.exe -HREK objects/weapons/assault_rifle/assault_rifle.weapon objects/vehicles/warthog/warthog.vehicle
```

Supported flags are `-HCEEK`/`-H1EK`, `-H2EK`, `-H3EK`, `-H3ODSTEK`, `-HREK`,
`-H4EK`, and `-H2AMPEK`/`-H2AEK`; flags are case-insensitive. Relative paths
are resolved beneath the configured editing kit's `tags` folder. Absolute paths
are accepted only when they point inside that same folder. Quote any path that
contains spaces. A command-line launch ignores the previous session and opens
only the requested tags.
